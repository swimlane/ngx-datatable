`ngx-datatable` is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data.  It has all the features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with _no external dependencies_. The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about your data or how you: filter, sort or page it.

It was built for modern browsers using _TypeScript, CSS3 and HTML5_ and Angular `>=4.0.0`. This is the sister project of the [angular-data-table](https://github.com/swimlane/angular-data-table) that is designed for Angular 1.x.

Check out the [documentation](https://swimlane.gitbooks.io/ngx-datatable/) & [demos](http://swimlane.github.io/ngx-datatable/) for more information!
